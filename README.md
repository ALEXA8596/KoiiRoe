Salmon was born as a fork of Sollet, and had it's code totally rewritten afterwards. As a result of our Riptide Hackaton presentation, we got honored with a Grant from the Serum Foundation.

We want to Salmon to be 100% transparent. Open-source software promotes decentralization and allows for a more democratic and inclusive ecosystem. It enables anyone to participate and contribute to the project, fostering long-term sustainability and growth.

It also helps to ensure the security and reliability of the code. Why should we use a closed-source self-custodial wallet then?
